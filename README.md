# unity3d graphics programmer roadmap.

This roadmap is taken from Telegram channel about computer graphics in Unity 3D  game engine.
Link to the channel: https://t.me/unity_cg

Every step of the roadmap is arranged in order of complication and increasing depth of understanding. 

The Author of this roadmap is the creator of the Telegram channel (https://t.me/unity_cg), not me. This is just a copy of the message from the channel to make this information more accessible. You can find more information in mentioned Telegram channel.

>Some of the listed content may be in Russian language.

>https://t.me/unity_cg uses Russian language as the main, but in case you'll write in English, I think people will understand you & answer to you.

##### If you think that these can be improved in any way, please do suggest. You can open an issue to do so.

# Math
- https://gamemath.com/book - one of the best book about math in games.

# Basics of Render Pipelines
- https://habr.com/ru/post/337484/ - very basics
- https://simonschreibt.de/gat/renderhell - slightly deeper
- https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/custom-srp - practice
- OpenGLInsights-TileBasedArchitectures.pdf - mobile related (google it)
- http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.296.5501&rep=rep1&type=pdf - in case you need more of this.
- https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2011/07/09/a-trip-through-the-graphics-pipeline-2011-index - in case you need more of this.

>P.S I would also recommend reading everything related to rendering from the book "Game Engine Architecture" / "Game Engine" in order to understand how the above works with the engine.

# Writing shaders (using code, not nodes)
- https://shaderdev.com - paid, but complete.
- https://www.cyanilux.com/tutorials/urp-shader-code - about new RPs.
- https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/rendering/
- https://thebookofshaders.com/ - how to make it beautifull. GLSL.
- Real-time rendering - The book. Something like a bible for graphical programmer.
- https://learn.jettelly.com/unity-shader-bible/ - wip, but seems good.

# Optimizations
- Frame Debugger, Unity Profiler - learn this tools in the first place.
- https://developer.arm.com/solutions/graphics-and-gaming/gaming-engine/unity/arm-guide-for-unity-developers
- Optimizing AAA Games for Mobile Platforms.pdf - Google it.
- Moving Mobile Graphics Cramming Software onto Mobile GPUs Lecturer Andrew Garrard Samsung R&D Institute UK SIGGRAPH August 2015 - google it.
- Usefull articles from playrix about Mobile GPU: [1](https://habr.com/ru/company/playrix/blog/492874/), [2](https://habr.com/ru/company/playrix/blog/498564/), [3](https://habr.com/ru/company/playrix/blog/506232/)
 
# Instruments
- https://www.desmos.com/calculator - formulas
- https://xibanya.github.io/UnityShaderViewer 

# Debug tools:
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/basic_tasks_and_concepts/viewing_your_gpu_workload_with_the_metal_debugger)
- [Renderdoc](https://renderdoc.org/)
- [Visual Studio](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-DebuggingD3D11ShadersWithVS.html) like renderdoc, but less functional
- Tools from manufacturers. ARM Studio for mobile, Snapdragon profiler (very detailed, but very uncomfortable to work with) and Xcode. 
- You can find more about Tools in [Telegram channel](https://t.me/unity_cg)
